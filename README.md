# Git flow cheat sheet
---

On your branch, you did some work, now you want to pull into staging

`git push origin your-branch-name`
`git checkout staging`
`git pull origin staging`

.

Deal with whatever comes up. You shouldn't have too many issues (if any) if you keep up to date

`git pull origin your-branch-name`

.

Fast forward, ideally. Or deal with changes/merge. Follow the prompts and remember to read!
`git push origin staging`

.

## DONE

### then...
`git checkout -b new-branch-name`
